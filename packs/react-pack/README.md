# React Pack

React-focused assets for ProjectHub projects. Currently includes a .gitignore template; React starters can be added here over time.

## Contents
- `templates/react-gitignore`: Ignore patterns tailored for React/Node projects (`react.gitignore`).
- `templates/react-workspace`: Vite-based React workspace starter (`package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `.eslintrc.json`).

## How to use
- For `.gitignore`: copy `templates/react-gitignore/react.gitignore` to your project root and rename to `.gitignore` (or append).
- For the workspace: copy `templates/react-workspace/` into your project, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

## Compatibility
- ProjectHub >= 1.0
- React projects (Node.js >= 18 recommended)
